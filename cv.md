Summary
I want to become an expert in the field of Front-End Development and web applications architecture, and start working as a Junior ReactJS engineer. This year, my goal is to work for an ambitious company, take on huge projects with motivated and strong programmers, design and build efficient&reusable front-end systems, abstractions. I still see Javascript as a future in web development industry.

My main jam is to complete given tasks in short amount of time. I like to work under time constraints. Since university, I am passionate about solving hard architectural/algorithmic questions, having completed 250-300 algorithm questions on Leetcode and HackerRank. I always try to write readable and structured code, find efficient solution in terms of time complexity, optimize code base for projects.

I have part-time experience in iOS development and published 1 app(CryptoNOW, a simple mining calculator) on AppStore within 3 months(iOS SDK, REST API, Moya, EasyPeasy UI layout) in summer 2018.  
I have one pure vanilla JS pet project - shop admin website developed while learning JavaScript(History API, REST API, Drag'n'Drop components, events).

Highly motivated, passionate and hard-working indie developer from Kazakhstan. My life motto - practice, learn and develop through extreme proactiveness and curiosity.
